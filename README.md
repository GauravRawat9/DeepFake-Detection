# DeepFake-Detection
Best model you can train and fine tune is Xception for Deepfake detection
And to keep saving best Xception model during fine tuning process, use the last code cell after basic training and saving was done for Xception model.
I used Kaggle notebook because it provides good GPU support for such model training.
